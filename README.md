<h1> get_next_line</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> In this project, we had to make a function in which would return a char * (a string) of the current line in a file descriptor.<br>
each time the function was called, it would return the next line in a file, if the file ended, it returns a NULL pointer.</p>

<h2>Using the function</h2>
<p>You need to compile the C files like your C files in your project :<br>
<code>gcc *.c</code>
<p>Inside your C program just import the function like this :<br>
<code>#include "get_next_line.h"</code>
<p>The function :<br>
<code>char *line = get_next_line(fd); // fd is the file descriptor (int)</code>
</p>
